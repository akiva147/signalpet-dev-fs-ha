A pathologic periapical lucency can appear as widening of the periodontal ligament space in the apical region, loss of lamina dura at the apex, or diffuse/irregular radiolucency at the apex and should be differentiated from a benign lucency such as a chevron lucency. Differential diagnoses for periapical lucency include abscess, cyst, inflammatory disease, or other causes. Radiographic signs should be interpreted in conjunction with the oral exam. Additional views may be necessary to confirm presence of pathology. Comparison to the same tooth on the contralateral side may be useful in determining if radiographic changes represent pathology or artifact, such as chevron lucency.",
